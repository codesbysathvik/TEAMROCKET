Advanced Phishing &amp; Malware Link Analyzer
 ##Problem
Modern phishing attacks use hidden redirects, disguised attachments, and obfuscation techniques that bypass basic filters. Traditional security tools often fail to detect these threats in real time, leaving users vulnerable.

##Challenge
Build a tool or browser extension that:
- Scans links and attachments in **real time**
- Uses **static + dynamic analysis** to detect malicious patterns
- Assigns **threat scores** (Low, Medium, High)
- Displays **clear warning prompts** when risks are detected
- Provides a **dashboard** summarizing all identified threats and overall system safety

##Expected Solution
A system that:
- Performs **real-time analysis** of URLs and attachments
- Assigns **risk levels** with detailed findings
- Warns users immediately via **browser extension alerts**
- Logs threats in a **dashboard** for easy monitoring
